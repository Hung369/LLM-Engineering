# LLM-Engineering

LLM-Engineering is a repository dedicated to advanced engineering techniques for large language models. The project focuses on improving LLM performance through strategies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning. By combining external knowledge sources and custom training approaches, the project delivers robust, context-aware, and domain-adaptable language model applications.

## Overview

Standalone language models often struggle with issues like factual inaccuracies and limited context. LLM-Engineering addresses these challenges by integrating external data sources and employing innovative fine-tuning techniques. This repository showcases two primary approaches:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines user queries with relevant external documents to enhance response accuracy.
- **Fine-tuning:** Utilizes advanced methods, including techniques like QLoRA, to adapt large models to specific tasks while reducing computational demands.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have:
- A Google account to access Google Colab.
- A Colab runtime configured to use a GPU for improved performance.
- Basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter notebooks.
- Familiarity with large language models and fine-tuning concepts.

## How to Run on Google Colab

The project is designed to run on Google Colab for ease of access and GPU support:

1. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
   - Open the notebook file in your browser.
   - Click the **"Open in Colab"** button (if available) or copy the URL and open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Configure the Environment:**
   - In Colab, go to **Runtime > Change runtime type** and select **GPU**.
   - Execute the initial cells to install all necessary dependencies automatically.

3. **Execute the Notebook:**
   - Run each cell sequentially. The notebook is organized to build upon previous steps.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions for any additional inputs or parameter configurations.

4. **Review the Results:**
   - Monitor the output for any errors during execution.
   - The final cells will display outputs such as the retrieved documents and the generated response from the model.

## Repository Structure

- **RAG_Reranking_LLAMA.ipynb:** Notebook demonstrating the RAG work flow using the LLAMA model.
- **QLoRA.ipynb:** Notebook focused on fine-tuning techniques on supervised learning text summarization.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview and guidance for the repository.

## RAG Work Flow

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process is divided into two main modules:

1. **Retrieval Module**
   - **Input:** A user’s query.
   - **Process:** Searches an external knowledge base (using tools like FAISS or ChromaDB) to find documents relevant to the query.
   - **Output:** A set of context documents that support the query.

2. **Generation Module**
   - **Input:** The original query combined with the retrieved context.
   - **Process:** The enriched input is fed into a language model (such as LLAMA or GPT) to generate a comprehensive and context-aware answer.
   - **Output:** The final generated response, leveraging both the model’s knowledge and the external context.

## Fine-tuning

This repository also explores fine-tuning strategies to adapt large language models for specific tasks. One key approach featured is QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), which:
- **Reduces Memory Footprint:** Utilizes quantization (e.g., 4-bit) to minimize resource usage.
- **Maintains Performance:** Achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer computational resources.
- **Adapts Efficiently:** Focuses on low-rank adaptations to fine-tune models without extensive retraining of all parameters.

## Future Work

Planned future enhancements include:
- Developing additional notebooks and scripts to support running the RAG pipeline on local environments.
- Integrating further evaluation metrics and optimization techniques to improve both RAG and fine-tuning performance.
