## Overview

This repository is dedicated to advanced LLM engineering with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning techniques, in order to enhance language model performance by leveraging external knowledge sources and custom training strategies, enabling more robust, context-aware, and domain-adaptable applications.

## RAG Work Flow

- **Retrieval-Enhanced Responses**: Fetches context from external sources (e.g., a vector database or embeddings store) before generating replies.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to plug in different retrieval backends or swap out the language model.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Works on local machines or in cloud environments such as Google Colab Pro/Pro+.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Supports adding your own dataset or domain-specific documents.
